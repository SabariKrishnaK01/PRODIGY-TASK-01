🌡️ Temperature Converter

This program is a straightforward and efficient temperature unit converter developed in Python. It prompts the user to enter a temperature value along with its unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and then calculates and displays the equivalent values in the other two units.

🛠️  Features

- Converts between Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K)
- Handles decimal input values
- User-friendly interface with prompts
- Continuous operation until user chooses to exit generate a more professional and add more features

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

-Handling user input and output in C
-Use of conditional (if/else) logic
-Performing calculations with floating-point numbers

💻 Example Output

Enter the temperature: 100
Enter the unit (C/F/K): c

Celsius: 100.00 C
Fahrenheit: 212.00 F
Kelvin: 373.15 K
